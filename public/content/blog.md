**Hello World!**
February 25, 2018

A redesign of my person website has been in the works since the start of the year. With so much going on with work and a bad case of the Chicagoan flu, it took me longer than I'd expected. That said, I’m excited to release an MVP of my _vanity_ site today. It was fun to get my CLI game back on (oh how I missed it). (I'm so over Wordpress and all of the other clunky CMSs out there — you know which ones I'm talking about).

I decided to give the JAMstack a go, using <a href=https:"www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a> to deploy this site. What an easy and streamlined process. I did encounter a few hiccups that caused my deployments to fail many times. Deprecated dependecies are _no bueno_. I was reminded by what a former web development teacher said: He told my class to expect our apps to fail hardcore and often during the dev process (they almost always do) and that Stack Overflow would become our best friend. For this project, he was right with the former, as I must have pushed commits to my Github repo about a thousand times after each edit to my code (yes, a tad bit OCD and paranoid). I learned a few new things from Stack Overflow, but didn’t rely on it too much since this was a relatively _easy_ (ahem!) project.

So _here we are face-to-face, a couple of silver spoons_ — ah the 80s! — and now that I have this new site up, I can’t wait to fill in some of the gaps that I left open. The _Works_ tab will be a portfolio of sorts, with projects that span the past decade or so. I also have a few fun projects in progress that I want to share with the universe. It's currently empty since I haven’t figured out the best way to present my work (so many options). Truth be told, I wanted to show images of kittens instead of leaving the section blank, but I thought better of it since the Internet is _meowed_ out.

If you want to reach me, shoot me an message in the “Contact” tab, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.  For now, “Hello world” (again).
