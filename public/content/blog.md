**Hello World!**

February 25, 2018

A redesign of my person website has been in the works since the start of the year. With so much going on with work and catching the 2018 strain of the flu, it took me longer than I'd expected. That said, I’m excited to release an MVP of my _vanity_ site today. It was fun to get my CLI game back on (oh how I missed it).

I decided to give the JAMstack a go, using <a href=https:"www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a> to deploy this site. What an easy and streamlined process! I did encounter a few hiccups that caused my deployments to fail many times. Deprecated dependecies are _no bueno_. I was reminded by what a former web development teacher said: He told my class to expect our apps to fail a lot and often during the dev process. For this project, he was right, as I must have pushed commits to my Github repo about a thousand times after each fix to my code (yes, a tad bit OCD and paranoid). Also it's amazing how fast web dev advances these days. What was once the _it_ stack only a year ago or even a month ago, is being usurped by something new. Very exciting stuff, I think. There are definitely a few new JavaScript frameworks and libraries that I'm itching to try out. I feel like a nerd in a sandbox.

So _here we are face-to-face, a couple of silver spoons_ — ah the 80s! — and now that I have this new site up, I can’t wait to fill in some of the gaps that I left open. The _Works_ tab will be a portfolio of sorts, with projects that I've done that span the past decade or so. I also have a few fun projects in progress that I want to share with the universe. It's currently empty since I haven’t figured out the best way to present my work (so many options). Truth be told, I wanted to build a slideshow of kittens instead of leaving the section blank, but I thought better of it since the Internet is _meowed_ out.

If you want to reach me, shoot me an message in the _Contact_ tab, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. For now, “Hello world” (again).
