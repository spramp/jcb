Based in Chicago, I work remotely as the Operations, New Media, and Curatorial Director of the <a href="http://www.centerforartandthought.org" target="_blank">Center for Art and Thought</a> (CA+T), an Los Angeles-based arts and culture nonprofit startup that has become an alternative educational platform that promotes and advocates for Filipino diasporic arts, writing, and scholarship. You can find me working remotely all throughout the city, in various coffee shops, co-working spaces, and on the University of Chicago campus. If I'm not building relationships with emerging artists and writers or managing digital content, figuring out ways to grow the organization, or trouble-shooting tech issues, I'm typically at work running my web development and visual communications consulting business, thinking up new web-based projects, learning new programming languages, and making neat things off- and online.

I'm passionate about the intersections of art and culture and civic engagement; LGBTQ and immigrant advocacy and rights; digital culture and social media for social good; and all things tech-related.

COMING SOON
A portfolio of things that I've created on this page soon!
