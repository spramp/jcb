**SPRING 2019**

After what seemed like almost a year of transitioning out of my last job and making lists of every possible thing that I wanted to do after, at the start of the year I made the decision to move forward on starting an art gallery. With over a decade of experience in academia training to research and write about contemporary Asian diasporic arts in the Americas and beyond, and working directly with artists in my nonprofit role of curatorial director for an arts virtual platform, the time, I thought, for me to venture on my own had come. I shifted gears mid-year last year and started planning my arrival to the Chicago art world in a commercial setting.

It's funny what months of thoughts percolating in one's mind can manifest. I couldn't have gotten far without the support of countless people in my social and political circles. Connections, I discovered, were essential for my many ideas to come into fruition.

By February 2018, I set out to navigate the byzantine bureaucratic world to start a business. A month later, with a newly organized business entity in hand as well as business license and requisite tax documents, I felt set to go. I had the good fortune to work with a leasing agent (who also happened to be the husband of my best friend in Chicago) to help me find a commercial space for the gallery. On a stroll around my neighborhood, I happened upon a historic building with flyers of available units posted outside. With nothing to lose, I gave my leasing agent a heads up about the space. A few weeks later, I was filling out paperwork to lease the commercial space, a unit that I would later find out was the former studio of the well-known Chicago artist Nick Cave. While my ambitions early on centered on finding, what in my mind I called a "starter space," the space that I ultimately leased was far more substantial but also had more fixing-up than I had imagined. Thought of "Maybe I'd gotten in over my head?" crossed my mind many times.

The leasing of the space came with it mounds otherwordly headaches, too many to name here. So with snafus piling up with the demolition and interior renovations, the opening date for the gallery, at this point I named FLXST Contemporary, kept being pushed further back, from May to now June. Had it not been for support coming from unexpected places, pressing forward would've been impossible. By the end of May, the space, freshly rehabbed, allowed me to see the official start of the gallery. My sights were set for a mid-June opening.

I could get into the granular details of everything I learned, good and bad, but I won't. Thinking about the amount of sweat equity (and real equity) that I put into the space to get it to its current state still exhausts me to this day. But lo-and-behold, FLXST Contemporary finally opened to a warm opening on June 12, 2019, with a show aptly titled "New Editions: Into the FLXST."

With "New Editions," I worked with 9 fresh emerging artists to create limited edition prints of new works. They can be found on [www.flxst.co](https://www.flxst.co). The final pieces from the artists are full of humor, timeliness, angst, pathos, and life, as each artist tapped into the cultural and political zeitgeist of the moment. I couldn't be happier.

Now that FLXST Contemporary exists in its physical form, I look forward to curating and fostering a community of artists and art lovers alike. Programming for the rest of the year and 2020 has begun in earnest and without any of the apprehension or nervousness (or very much it, I should say) that I had when I first began strategizing the founding of FLXST.

Why the name FLXST? There's definitely a reference to my favorite 20th-century art movement, the FLUXUS movement, especially with its notable happenings and the artwork's ability to engage communities of artists and participants (plus FLUXUS will always be a "queer" movement in my conceptualization of the period). For me, too, FLXST is a state of being as it signifies the movements of bodies, culture, ideas, and art across time and space. It's the flux in FLXST (imagine the sound) that keeps the name kinetic, and in it, the artists and their artwork. We are all in some way or another in a state of flux. Always being acted upon or taking action.

I left the vowels out of FLXST deliberately. Reading it becomes an exercise for the reader/viewer to imagine and insert the missing letters. Just with the name, FLXST engages the viewer; it causes double-takes; and it makes the viewer work to understand meaning. The artwork that FLXST showcases does all of that and more. FLXST is about the cultural work of the art and artists as well as the work of the viewer to find their footing in all that they are looking at, hearing, experiencing.

FLXST Contemporary is now open. Visit the gallery on M-Th from 10-12pm and 1-3pm; or make an appointment to see the current show by emailing info[at]flxst.co on Fridays and the weekends. Visit [www.flxst.co](https://flxst.co) to purchase any of the limited edition prints in the current show "New Editions: Into the FLXST."

Many, many thanks to the long list of people (you know who you are) who helped make this new chapter in my life possible. #artmatters @flxstco
