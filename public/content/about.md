I am _curious_. I have carried a sense of wonder and discovery since childhood. As a kid, I often took household gadgets methodically apart and reassembled them later to figure out how they worked. To this day curiosity and problem-solving have worked in tandem with how I approach new projects and processes.

I am a _life-long learner_ and _thought leader_. The time that I devoted to my Ph.D. conveys my dedication to and successful completion of a rigorous multi-year project. It fostered my love for research and writing, and it taught me to embrace collaboration and criticism. I developed an ethos of transformational leadership that I employ today that combines creativity, humor, and empathy. I am a published scholar in peer-reviewed journals (you can find my scholarship on <a href="https://goo.gl/CJn8hY" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> or <a href="http://centerforartandthought.academia.edu/JanChristianBernabeAcademia.edu" target="_blank">Academia.edu</a>). I also use platforms like _Quora_ and _Medium_ to publish essays about higher education, nonprofit management, arts and culture, and other topics.

I am a _growth hacker_. Under my digital content management and operations and marketing leadership at the <a href="http://www.centerforartandthought.org" target="_blank">Center for Art and Thought</a> (CA+T), I helm the growth of CA+T’s brand through curation of digital content; social media management; and pilot initiatives that combine the analog and digital. Unique global visits, page views, and user engagement on CA+T's website have increased steadily under my direction.

I am a _polymath_. I possess a talent for ideation, communication, and product development—transforming minimum viable products (MVPs) to minimum marketable products (MMPs). I trained at General Assembly to become a full stack agile web developer. As a visual communications consultant, I create dynamic web apps and print and digital video projects for clients.

I am a _maker_. With an eye for aesthetics, I strive to create thoughtfully designed projects. I also aim to make processes more streamlined and better. I have a proven track-record of turning ideas into accessible, meaningful, and functional products and solutions.
