A Filipinx American genderqueer queer based in Chicago, Jan Christian Bernabe (“he, him, his”) is the Chief Creative & Operations Director and Founder of *FLXST* Contemporary, a contemporary art space and incubator in the South Loop for emerging and mid-career artists. He is also an educator and scholar, independent curator, and art & culture critic/writer. He has taught courses in art history and visual culture studies, race and representation, and gender and queer studies (among other topics) at the University of Michigan, Cornish College of the Arts, and Whitman College. With a Ph.D. in the Program in American Culture from the University of Michigan, he has written for *postions: asia critique*, *Wasafiri Magazine*, *Verge: Studies in Global Asias*, *Asian Diasporic Visual Cultures and the Americas*, the *Filipino American Artist Directory* and other academic and non-academic outlets.  With the artist-academic Laura Kina, he co-edited *Queering Contemporary Asian American Art* published by the University of Washington Press (2017) and is at work on the second volume of the project. As a scholar and academic, he specializes in the history of visual culture studies in the United States as seen through the lens of visual technologies, like print, photography, film, and most recently, the digital media and the Internet. He is also invested in surfacing underrepresented visual makers, whether artists, photographer, or filmmakers, in his research, writing, and curating. As a life-long learner and knowledge maker, he is interested in the intersections of Filipinx diasporic art, queer cultural practices, and civic engagement & social justice. When not running *FLXST* Contemporary or researching and writing about art and photography, Jan serves as a member of the Community Advisory Group for Equality Illinois, a Core Leader for AFIRE Chicago, and a Critique Group Instructor for Latitude Chicago. He also supports other local community social justice and arts organizations in Chicago. He is a fierce advocate for LGBTQ+ immigrant rights, racial and economic social justice, and transgender affirming policies for Illinois and across the US.
