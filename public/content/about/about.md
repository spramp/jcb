I am _curious_. I have carried a sense of wonder and discovery since childhood. As a kid, I often took household gadgets methodically apart and reassembled them later to figure out how they worked. To this day curiosity and problem-solving have worked in tandem with how I approach new projects and processes. I have developed an ethos of leadership that combines creativity, mindfulness, humor, and empathy.

I am a _life-long learner_ and _thought leader_. The time that I devoted to my Ph.D. conveys my dedication to and successful completion of a rigorous multi-year project. It fostered my love for research and writing, and it taught me to embrace collaboration and criticism. I am a _published scholar_ in peer-reviewed journals and an edited a scholarly art anthology (you can find my scholarship on <a href="https://goo.gl/CJn8hY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Scholar</a> or <a href="http://centerforartandthought.academia.edu/JanChristianBernabe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academia.edu</a>). I also use platforms like _Quora_ and _Medium_ to publish essays about higher education, nonprofit management, arts and culture, and other topics.

I am a _growth hacker_. Under my operations, digital content management, and marketing leadership at the <a href="http://www.centerforartandthought.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Art and Thought</a> (CA+T), I helm the growth of CA+T’s brand through curation of digital content; social media management; and pilot initiatives that combine the analog and digital. Unique global visits, page views, and user engagement on CA+T's website have increased steadily under my direction.

I am a _polymath_. I possess a talent for ideation, communication, and product development—transforming minimum viable products (MVPs) to minimum marketable products and solutions. I trained at General Assembly to become a junior full stack agile web developer and have employed the Scrum framework in dev projects. As a visual communications consultant, I create responsive web apps and design print projects for clients. I love technology — from its use in optimizing workflow and project management to advancing social good.

I am a _maker_. With an eye for aesthetics, I strive to create thoughtfully designed projects. I also aim to make processes streamlined and better. I have a proven track-record of turning ideas into accessible, meaningful, and functional products and solutions.

If anything catches your eye, say hello.
